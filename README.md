# Human Resource Data Analytics

This project focuses on the crucial task of cleansing, transforming, and analyzing raw Human Resource (HR) data using the powerful capabilities of MySQL. By identifying and resolving inconsistencies, and errors within the dataset, we lay a solid foundation for meaningful analysis.

Once the data is cleansed, we proceed to transform it into a standardized format, enabling seamless integration and compatibility across various HR systems. Through the strategic application of MySQL's data manipulation techniques, we shape the data into a structured and organized framework, ready for analysis.
